# Getting Started with ESDb-Backend

This is the backend of the project [ESDb](https://github.com/DishaMahajan22/ESDb)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the backend route in your browser. Currently there is no default backend route coded in this application so you may see nothing. Check local logs instead.

> Note that without opening the frontend repo [ESDb](https://github.com/DishaMahajan22/ESDb) in a new window and running it locally at the same time as the backend, nothing will occur in the backend.
